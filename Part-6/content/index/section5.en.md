Joe is one of the best IT/Business professionals I have had an opportunity to work with. He is very mature, detail-oriented, and analytical. He looks at the client’s needs, and ensures that we can meet them in the most innovative, yet cost effective way. Joe has become my friend, mentor, and a business partner.

I recommend Jozef as a focused and constructive-solutions-seeking person. I am glad I worked with him and his team. What made our cooperation smooth was that his whole team seemed devoted to issues we had to deal with. I believe that the team worked that good because it was led by such a professional like Jozef.
